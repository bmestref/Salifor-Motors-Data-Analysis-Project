    The primary goals are to analyze the HR department's collected data and develop a model to predict whether an employee will leave the company.
    By predicting which employees are likely to quit, it may be possible to identify factors contributing to their departure.
    Finding, interviewing, and hiring new employees is time-consuming and costly. Therefore, increasing employee retention will benefit the company.
    The project aims to analyze HR data and create a predictive model to help strategize incentives for employees to remain with the company.
    When it comes to the stakeholders, the primary stakeholders are the HR department managers who want to improve employee retention initiatives. 
    They have collected data to gain insights into employee satisfaction.
    These stakeholders seek data-driven recommendations to understand what factors are likely to cause employees to leave the company.
    As the data professional, I need to inspect the data for integrity through exploratory data analysis.
    The provided data is in a CSV file named HR_capstone_dataset.csv.
    From my analysis following the PACE methodology, I conclude the business should prioritize addressing employees with low satisfaction levels, 
    lower evaluations, and higher-than-average monthly work hours, as these employees are at the highest risk of leaving the company.
    Conduct regular surveys, such as quarterly, to monitor employee satisfaction levels.
    Also, I recomment to improve morale for employees with low evaluations through regular check-ins and career coaching.
    Compensate employees who work more than the average monthly hours with either time off or overtime pay to balance the extra hours worked.
    The linear regression model could be improved by optimizing it, especially considering the dataset's imbalance.
    However, some adjustments and improvments on our models should be performed: the data should be cross-validated before implementing the models. 
    Splitting the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets would ensure more accurate and reliable model performance.
    More hyperparameters should be used to tune the random forest and XGBoost models, as only five were used initially. This would help in building a better-performing model.
